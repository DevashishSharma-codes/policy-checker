Policy Checker: AI-Powered Document Query Platform
ðŸ“„ Chat with Your Documents, Get Instant Answers
Policy Checker is a web application that transforms your static PDF documents into dynamic, searchable knowledge bases. Leveraging advanced AI, it allows you to ask natural language questions about your uploaded documents and receive precise, evidence-backed answers directly from the text.

âœ¨ Features
Secure Document Upload: Easily upload your PDF documents (e.g., insurance policies, legal contracts, resumes) to a secure cloud storage powered by Supabase.

Natural Language Querying: Ask questions in plain English, just like you're having a conversation.

Example for Insurance: "Does my 3-month-old policy cover a 46-year-old male's knee surgery in Pune?"

Example for General Documents: "What are Devashish Sharma's key skills and qualifications?"

AI-Powered Contextual Answers: Get accurate and highly relevant responses generated by Google's Gemini AI.

Transparent Justification: Each answer is accompanied by exact quotes or clauses directly from your uploaded document, ensuring trustworthiness and allowing for easy verification.

ðŸ’¡ How It Works (Behind the Scenes) 
Policy Checker is built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture type system , which combines the power of information retrieval with cutting-edge generative AI.

Document Ingestion (Retrieval Phase):

When you upload a PDF, the system extracts all its text content.

This extracted text forms a rich knowledge base that the AI can reference.

Intelligent Question Answering (Augmentation & Generation Phase):

Your natural language question and the extracted document text are securely sent to Google's Gemini AI.

The AI acts as a sophisticated "document query-solving agent," instructed to answer your question solely based on the provided PDF text. This crucial step prevents the AI from generating inaccurate or irrelevant information.

The AI then synthesizes a clear and concise answer, explicitly citing the supporting lines or sections from the original document.
